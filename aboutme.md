*"...the best teaching can be done only when there is a direct individual relationship between a student and a good teacher — a situation in which the student discusses the ideas, thinks about the things, and talks about the things. It’s impossible to learn very much by simply sitting in a lecture, or even by simply doing problems that are assigned..."* **- Richard Feynman** (you know, the greatest american physicist to ever live)

### PRICING

It is important to us to keep our prices low, we don’t find it necessary to charge 50-100 dollars an hour to do something we love to do.  Depending on the subject most sessions cost between 15-25 dollars when conducted in the downtown SLC area.  Sessions conducted in the Greater Salt Lake area, depending on subject, cost between 25-35 dollars.  We give multiple hour and multiple student discounts and are flexible on times and locations.
